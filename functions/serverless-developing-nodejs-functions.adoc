After you have xref:serverless-create-func-kn_serverless-functions-getting-started[created a Node.js function project], you can modify the template files provided to add business logic to your function. This includes configuring function invocation and the returned headers and status codes.

[id="serverless-developing-nodejs-functions-about-invoking"]
== About invoking Node.js functions

When using the Knative (`kn`) CLI to create a function project, you can generate a project that responds to CloudEvents, or one that responds to simple HTTP requests. CloudEvents in Knative are transported over HTTP as a POST request, so both function types listen for and respond to incoming HTTP events.

Node.js functions can be invoked with a simple HTTP request. When an incoming request is received, functions are invoked with a `context` object as the first parameter.
