[id="serverless-developing-typescript-functions-about-invoking"]
== About invoking TypeScript functions

When using the Knative (`kn`) CLI to create a function project, you can generate a project that responds to CloudEvents or one that responds to simple HTTP requests. CloudEvents in Knative are transported over HTTP as a POST request, so both function types listen for and respond to incoming HTTP events.

TypeScript functions can be invoked with a simple HTTP request. When an incoming request is received, functions are invoked with a `context` object as the first parameter.
