A Knative _event source_ can be any Kubernetes object that generates or imports cloud events, and relays those events to another endpoint, known as a xref:serverless-event-sinks[_sink_]. Sourcing events is critical to developing a distributed system that reacts to events.

You can create and manage Knative event sources by using the *Developer* perspective in the {ocp-product-title} web console, the Knative (`kn`) CLI, or by applying YAML files.

Currently, {ServerlessProductName} supports the following event source types:

xref:serverless-apiserversource[API server source]:: Brings Kubernetes API server events into Knative. The API server source sends a new event each time a Kubernetes resource is created, updated or deleted.

xref:serverless-pingsource[Ping source]:: Produces events with a fixed payload on a specified cron schedule.

xref:serverless-kafka-developer-source[Kafka event source]:: Connects an Apache Kafka cluster to a sink as an event source.

You can also create a xref:serverless-custom-event-sources[custom event source].
