= Source for Apache Kafka
:context: serverless-kafka-developer-source


You can create an Apache Kafka source that reads events from an Apache Kafka cluster and passes these events to a sink. You can create a Kafka source by using the {ocp-product-title} web console, the Knative (`kn`) CLI, or by creating a `KafkaSource` object directly as a YAML file and using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to apply it.
