= Sink for Apache Kafka
:context: serverless-kafka-developer-sink


Apache Kafka sinks are a type of xref:serverless-event-sinks[event sink] that are available if a cluster administrator has enabled Apache Kafka on your cluster. You can send events directly from an xref:knative-event-sources[event source] to a Kafka topic by using a Kafka sink.
