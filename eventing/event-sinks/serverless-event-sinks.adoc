Addressable objects receive and acknowledge an event delivered over HTTP to an address defined in their `status.address.url` field. As a special case, the core Kubernetes `Service` object also fulfills the addressable interface.

Callable objects are able to receive an event delivered over HTTP and transform the event, returning `0` or `1` new events in the HTTP response. These returned events may be further processed in the same way that events from an external event source are processed.

[TIP]
====
You can configure which CRs can be used with the `--sink` flag for Knative (`kn`) CLI commands by link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_serverless/1.29/html-single/knative_cli/#advanced-kn-config[Customizing `kn`].
