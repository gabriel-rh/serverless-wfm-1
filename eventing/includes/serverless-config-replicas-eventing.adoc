= Configuring high availability replicas for Knative Eventing

High availability (HA) is available by default for the Knative Eventing `eventing-controller`, `eventing-webhook`, `imc-controller`, `imc-dispatcher`, and `mt-broker-controller` components, which are configured to have two replicas each by default. You can change the number of replicas for these components by modifying the `spec.high-availability.replicas` value in the `KnativeEventing` custom resource (CR).

[NOTE]
====
For Knative Eventing, the `mt-broker-filter` and `mt-broker-ingress` deployments are not scaled by HA. If multiple deployments are needed, scale these components manually.
