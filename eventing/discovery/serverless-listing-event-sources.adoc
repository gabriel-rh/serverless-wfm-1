= Listing event sources and event source types
:context: serverless-listing-event-sources


It is possible to view a list of all event sources or event source types that exist or are available for use on your {ocp-product-title} cluster. You can use the Knative (`kn`) CLI or the *Developer* perspective in the {ocp-product-title} web console to list available event sources or event source types.
