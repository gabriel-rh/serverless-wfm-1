The Knative (`kn`) CLI supports the use of plugins, which enable you to extend the functionality of your `kn` installation by adding custom commands and other shared commands that are not part of the core distribution. Knative (`kn`) CLI plugins are used in the same way as the main `kn` functionality.

Currently, Red Hat supports the `kn-source-kafka` plugin and the `kn-event` plugin.
