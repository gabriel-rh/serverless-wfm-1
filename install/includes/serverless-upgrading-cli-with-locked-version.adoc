= Upgrading the Knative CLI with locked version

You can manually upgrade the Knative (`kn`) CLI version that has previously been version-locked.

.Procedure


. Check whether upgraded packages are available:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dnf search --showduplicates openshift-serverless-clients
----

. Remove the version lock of `kn`:
[source,terminal]
----
# dnf versionlock delete openshift-serverless-clients
----

. Lock `kn` to the new version:
[source,terminal]
----
# dnf versionlock add --raw 'openshift-serverless-clients-1.8.*'
----
+
This example uses the `kn` version that is based on Knative 1.8.

. Upgrade to the new available version:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dnf install --upgrade openshift-serverless-clients
----
