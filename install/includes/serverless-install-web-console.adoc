= Installing the {ServerlessOperatorName} from the web console

You can install the {ServerlessOperatorName} from the OperatorHub by using the {ocp-product-title} web console. Installing this Operator enables you to install and use Knative components.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.
* For {ocp-product-title}, your cluster has the Marketplace capability enabled or the Red Hat Operator catalog source configured manually.


* You have logged in to the  web console.

.Procedure

. In the web console, navigate to the *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* page.

. Scroll, or type the keyword *Serverless* into the *Filter by keyword* box to find the {ServerlessOperatorName}.

. Review the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:

.. The *Installation Mode* is *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*. This mode installs the Operator in the default `openshift-serverless` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster.

.. The *Installed Namespace* is `openshift-serverless`.

.. Select an *Update Channel*.
+
* The *stable* channel enables installation of the latest stable release of the {ServerlessOperatorName}. The *stable* channel is the default.
* To install another version, specify the corresponding *stable-x.y* channel, for example *stable-1.29*.

.. Select the *stable* channel as the *Update Channel*. The *stable* channel will enable installation of the latest stable release of the {ServerlessOperatorName}.

.. Select *Automatic* or *Manual* approval strategy.

. Click *Install* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on this {ocp-product-title} cluster.

. From the *Catalog* -> *Operator Management* page, you can monitor the {ServerlessOperatorName} subscription's installation and upgrade progress.

.. If you selected a *Manual* approval strategy, the subscription's upgrade status will remain *Upgrading* until you review and approve its install plan. After approving on the *Install Plan* page, the subscription upgrade status moves to *Up to date*.

.. If you selected an *Automatic* approval strategy, the upgrade status should resolve to *Up to date* without intervention.

.Verification

After the Subscription's upgrade status is *Up to date*, select *Catalog* -> *Installed Operators* to verify that the {ServerlessOperatorName} eventually shows up and its *Status* ultimately resolves to *InstallSucceeded* in the relevant namespace.

If it does not:

. Switch to the *Catalog* -> *Operator Management* page and inspect the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors under *Status*.

. Check the logs in any pods in the `openshift-serverless` project on the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page that are reporting issues to troubleshoot further.
