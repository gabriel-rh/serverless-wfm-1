= Locking version for the Knative CLI installed with RPM package manager

You might require to use Knative (`kn`) CLI version that is not the most recent, but is in Maintenance Phase. You can achieve that by locking the version of `kn`, which prevents it from being upgraded.

.Procedure

. Install the `versionlock` plugin for the DNF package manager:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dnf install 'dnf-command(versionlock)'
----

. Lock the version of `kn` by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# dnf versionlock add --raw 'openshift-serverless-clients-1.7.*'
----
+
This command locks `kn` to be the version based on Knative 1.7, which is in Maintenance Phase at the time of release of {ServerlessProductName} 1.29.
