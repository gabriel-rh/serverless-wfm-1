= Configuring Knative broker for Apache Kafka
:context: serverless-kafka-admin


The Knative broker implementation for Apache Kafka provides integration options for you to use supported versions of the Apache Kafka message streaming platform with {ServerlessProductName}. Kafka provides options for event source, channel, broker, and event sink capabilities.

In addition to the Knative Eventing components that are provided as part of a core {ServerlessProductName} installation, the `KnativeKafka` custom resource (CR) can be installed by:

* Cluster administrators, for {ocp-product-title}
* Cluster or dedicated administrators, for {rosa-product-title} or for {dedicated-product-title}.

The `KnativeKafka` CR provides users with additional options, such as:

* Kafka source
* Kafka channel
* Kafka broker
* Kafka sink
