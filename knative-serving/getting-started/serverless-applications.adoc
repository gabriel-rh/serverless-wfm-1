You can create a serverless application by using one of the following methods:

* Create a Knative service from the {ocp-product-title} web console.

For {ocp-product-title}, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/applications/creating_applications/odc-creating-applications-using-developer-perspective.html#odc-creating-applications-using-developer-perspective[Creating applications using the Developer perspective] for more information.

* Create a Knative service by using the Knative (`kn`) CLI.
* Create and apply a Knative `Service` object as a YAML file, by using the `oc` CLI.

// create service using CLI

// create service using YAML
include::../includes/creating-serverless-apps-yaml.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

If you do not want to switch to the *Developer* perspective in the {ocp-product-title} web console or use the Knative (`kn`) CLI or YAML files, you can create Knative components by using the *Administator* perspective of the {ocp-product-title} web console.

// Create services as an admin

// offline mode
