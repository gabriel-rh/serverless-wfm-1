= Resolving image tags to digests
:context: resolving-image-tags-to-digests

If the Knative Serving controller has access to the container registry, Knative Serving resolves image tags to a digest when you create a revision of a service. This is known as _tag-to-digest resolution_, and helps to provide consistency for deployments.
