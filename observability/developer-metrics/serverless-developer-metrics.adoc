= {ServerlessProductShortName} developer metrics overview
:context: serverless-developer-metrics


Metrics enable developers to monitor how Knative services are performing. You can use the {ocp-product-title} monitoring stack to record and view health checks and metrics for your Knative services.

You can view different metrics for {ServerlessProductName} by navigating to link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/monitoring/reviewing-monitoring-dashboards.html#reviewing-monitoring-dashboards-developer_reviewing-monitoring-dashboards[*Dashboards*] in the  web console *Developer* perspective.

[WARNING]
====
If {SMProductShortName} is enabled with mTLS, metrics for Knative Serving are disabled by default because Service Mesh prevents Prometheus from scraping metrics.

For information about resolving this issue, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_serverless/1.29/html-single/integrations/#serverless-ossm-enabling-serving-metrics_serverless-ossm-setup[Enabling Knative Serving metrics when using Service Mesh with mTLS].

Scraping the metrics does not affect autoscaling of a Knative service, because scraping requests do not go through the activator. Consequently, no scraping takes place if no pods are running.
