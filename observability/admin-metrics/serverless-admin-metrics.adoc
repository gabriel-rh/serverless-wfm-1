:context: serverless-admin-metrics


Metrics enable cluster administrators to monitor how {ServerlessProductName} cluster components and workloads are performing.

You can view different metrics for {ServerlessProductName} by navigating to link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/monitoring/reviewing-monitoring-dashboards.html#reviewing-monitoring-dashboards-admin_reviewing-monitoring-dashboards[*Dashboards*] in the web console *Administrator* perspective.

== Prerequisites

* See the {ocp-product-title} documentation on link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/monitoring/managing-metrics.html#managing-metrics[Managing metrics] for information about enabling metrics for your cluster.

* You have access to an account with cluster administrator access (or dedicated administrator access for {dedicated-product-title} or {rosa-product-title}).

* You have access to the *Administrator* perspective in the web console.

[WARNING]
====
If {SMProductShortName} is enabled with mTLS, metrics for Knative Serving are disabled by default because Service Mesh prevents Prometheus from scraping metrics.

For information about resolving this issue, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_serverless/1.29/html-single/integrations/#serverless-ossm-enabling-serving-metrics_serverless-ossm-setup[Enabling Knative Serving metrics when using Service Mesh with mTLS].

Scraping the metrics does not affect autoscaling of a Knative service, because scraping requests do not go through the activator. Consequently, no scraping takes place if no pods are running.
